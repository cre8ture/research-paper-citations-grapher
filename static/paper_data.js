      title: 'What is machine learning?',
      abstract: 'To cite: Baloglu O, Latifi SQ, Nazha A. Arch Dis Child Educ Pract Ed Epub ahead of print: [please include Day Month Year]. doi:10.1136/ archdischild-2020-319415 © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial reuse. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ. The term machine learning (ML) is emerging more often in the medical literature. There are successful clinical applications of ML with the specialties of ophthalmology and radiology leading the way. For example, in ophthalmology the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, and in radiology the diagnosis of stroke or cancers from digital images is promising. This success is expected to expand into other medical disciplines including general paediatrics and its subspecialties. Therefore, healthcare practitioners and researchers are most likely to benefit from getting familiar with ML terminology in order to stay up to date and better understand the ML research methodology and its applications in medicine. This brief review is intended to be an introduction to ML and its associated terminology, and to review selected studies with ML models from the paediatric literature.',

      title: 'Fashion-MNIST: a Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms',
      abstract: 'We present Fashion-MNIST, a new dataset comprising of 28x28 grayscale images of 70,000 fashion products from 10 categories, with 7,000 images per category. The training set has 60,000 images and the test set has 10,000 images. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size, data format and the structure of training and testing splits. The dataset is freely available at this https URL',

      title: 'TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning',
      abstract: 'TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. Tensor-Flow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom-designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with a focus on training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.',

      title: 'TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systems',
      abstract: 'TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.',

      title: 'Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting',
      abstract: 'The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.',

      title: 'Machine learning: Trends, perspectives, and prospects',
      abstract: 'Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of today’s most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.',
